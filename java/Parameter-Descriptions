Collective Loss of Significance Parameters - see src/RunSimulation.java

questValueDistributionMean - The mean value of the normal distribution specifying a quest value for an agent. Minimum quest value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

questValueDistributionSD - The standard deviation of the normal distribution specifying a quest value for an agent. Minimum quest value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

questThresholdDistributionMean - The mean value of the normal distribution specifying a quest threshold value for an agent. Minimum quest threshold value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

questThresholdDistributionSD - The standard deviation of the normal distribution specifying a quest threshold value for an agent. Minimum quest threshold value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

ideologyValueDistributionMean - The mean value of the normal distribution specifying an ideology value for an agent. Minimum ideology value is 0 and maximum value is 1. According to model description this distribution should be right-skewed.

ideologyValueDistributionSD - The standard deviation of the normal distribution specifying an ideology value for an agent. Minimum ideology value is 0 and maximum value is 1. According to model description this distribution should be right-skewed.

threatSuspectibilityDistributionMean - The mean value of the normal distribution specifying the threat suspectibility value for an agent. Minimum threat suspectibility value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

threatSuspectibilityDistributionSD - The standard deviation of the normal distribution specifying the threat suspectibility value for an agent. Minimum threat suspectibility value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

numberOfAgents - The number of agents in the model. In order to generate realistic social networks the minimum number of agents to simulate is 500 and the maximum is 20,000.

nmberOfTimeSteps - The number of time steps in the model. The minimum number of time steps is 1 and the maximum number of time steps is 100,000.

networkHomophily - The extent to which the social networks the agents are placed in are homophilous with regard to ideology (ideology value < 0.5 is non-violent; ideology value > 0.5 is violent). The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1.

extremeIdeologyThreshold - The polar cutoffs to determine extreme agents with extreme ideology. For non-violent agents the extreme threshold is determined by: 0 to extremeIdeologyThreshold. For violent agents the extreme threshold is determined by: 1 to (1-extremeIdeologyThreshold).

corrBetweenViolentIdeologyAndQuestValue - The correlation between how extreme a violent individual's ideology is (close to 1) and their quest value. This value can range between -1 and 1.

corrBetweenNonViolentIdeologyAndQuestValue - The correlation between how extreme a non-violent individual's violent is (close to 1) and their quest value. This value can range between -1 and 1.

onQuestNetworkInfluence - The overall influence an agent's social network has on their ideology in a given time step when they are on a quest (their quest value is greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

nonQuestNetworkInfluence - The overall influence an agent's social network has on their ideology and their quest value in a given time step whenthey are not on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

onQuestStepSignficanceReduction - The reduction in the quest value of an agent each time step that they are on a quest (their quest value is greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

ifOnQuestInfluenceOfExtremeAgent - The influence an agent with an extreme ideology has on an agent in their social who is on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

ifOnQuestInfluenceOfSameIdeologyAgent - The influence an agent of the same ideology has on an agent in their social who is on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

ifOnQuestInfluenceOfSameIdeologyAgent - The influence an agent with a violent ideology (ideology value > 0.5) has on an agent in their social who is on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

individualLossEventFrequency  - Frequency with which individual loss events occur.

individualLossEventDistributionMean - mean intensity of an individual loss event when it occurs.

individualLossEventDistributionSD - standard deviation of the intensity of an individual loss event when it occurs.

nonLossEventQuestValueReduction - amount the quest value of a non-quest agent is reduced when s/he does not experience an individual loss event.

lossEvents - a list of all collective loss events to simulate
 * each loss event is given a time stamp to indicate when it occurs and an intensity level.
 * the intensity level reflect the extent to which each agent's quest value will be raised.
 * the minimum value for a time stamp of a collective loss event is 1 and the maximum value is nmberOfTimeSteps. 
 * the minimum value of an intensity level of a collective loss event is 0 and the maximum value is 1.
