Individual Loss of Significance Parameters - see src/RunSimulation.java

questValueDistributionMean - The mean value of the normal distribution specifying a quest value for an agent. Minimum quest value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

questValueDistributionSD - The standard deviation of the normal distribution specifying a quest value for an agent. Minimum quest value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

questThresholdDistributionMean - The mean value of the normal distribution specifying a quest threshold value for an agent. Minimum quest threshold value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

questThresholdDistributionSD - The standard deviation of the normal distribution specifying a quest threshold value for an agent. Minimum quest threshold value is 0 and maximum value is 1.

ideologyValueDistributionMean - The mean value of the normal distribution specifying an ideology value for an agent. Minimum ideology value is 0 and maximum value is 1. According to model description this distribution should be right-skewed.

ideologyValueDistributionSD - The standard deviation of the normal distribution specifying an ideology value for an agent. Minimum ideology value is 0 and maximum value is 1. According to model description this distribution should be right-skewed.

numberOfAgents - The number of agents in the model. In order to generate realistic social networks the minimum number of agents to simulate is 500 and the maximum is 20,000.

nmberOfTimeSteps - The number of time steps in the model. The minimum number of time steps is 1 and the maximum number of time steps is 100,000.

networkHomophily - The extent to which the social networks the agents are placed in are homophilous with regard to ideology (ideology value < 0.5 is non-violent; ideology value > 0.5 is violent). The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1.

extremeIdeologyThreshold - The polar cutoffs to determine extreme agents with extreme ideology. For non-violent agents the extreme threshold is determined by: 0 to extremeIdeologyThreshold. For violent agents the extreme threshold is determined by: 1 to (1-extremeIdeologyThreshold).

corrBetweenIdeologyAndQuestValue - The correlation extent to which an individual's ideology is extreme (close to 0 and close to 1)  and the quest value of the agent. This value can range between -1 and 1.

onQuestNetworkInfluence - The overall influence an agent's social network has on their ideology in a given time step when they are on a quest (their quest value is greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

nonQuestNetworkInfluence - The overall influence an agent's social network has on their ideology and their quest value in a given time step whenthey are not on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

onQuestStepSignficanceReduction - The reduction in the quest value of an agent each time step that they are on a quest (their quest value is greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

ifOnQuestInfluenceOfExtremeAgent - The influence an agent with an extreme ideology has on an agent in their social who is on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

ifOnQuestInfluenceOfSameIdeologyAgent - The influence an agent of the same ideology has on an agent in their social who is on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.

ifOnQuestInfluenceOfSameIdeologyAgent - The influence an agent with a violent ideology (ideology value > 0.5) has on an agent in their social who is on a quest (their quest value is not greater than their quest threshold value). This value can range between 0 and 1.
