Loss of Significance Models

These models reflect the loss of significance work from the MOTIVATED COGNITION LAB at the University of Maryland led by Dr. Arie Kruglanski. Currently two models are instantiated on based on individual loss of signficance, the other based on collective loss of significance.

A description of these models is in the description-of-sims folder.

Information about the parameters for each model can be found in the PARAMETERS folder for the respective model (java/CollectiveLossOfSignificance or java/IndividualLossOfSignificance)
Compiling and running the models

The models are written in the JAVA programming language and use the external libraries provided in the libs folder. Thus compiling and running the models requires the JAVA Development Kit (JDK) to be installed on one's computer.

To compile a model one needs to navigate to use the Terminal or the Command line to navigate to the source code directory for the model s/he is interested in (i.e. java/CollectiveLossOfSignificance/src/ or java/IndividualLossOfSignificance/src/)

Next one needs to compile all the java files (*.java) in the directory and include the libraries indicated in libs folder in the java classpath. Then one needs to run the .class file RunSimulation.

For example if one was interested in the collective loss of significance model s/he would navigate to  java/CollectiveLossOfSignificance/src/ and then type the following into the Command Prompt or Terminal:

Terminal / Mac from source folder

javac -cp ../../../libs/gs-core-1.3.jar:../../../libs/gs-algo-1.3.jar:../../../libs/commons-math3-3.6.1.jar *.java 

java -cp ../../../libs/gs-core-1.3.jar:../../../libs/gs-algo-1.3.jar:../../../libs/commons-math3-3.6.1.jar:. RunSimulation

Command Prompt / Windows:
javac -cp ..\..\..\libs\gs-core-1.3.jar:..\..\..\libs/gs-algo-1.3.jar:..\..\..\libs\commons-math3-3.6.1.jar *.java 

java -cp ..\..\..\libs\gs-core-1.3.jar:..\..\..\libs/gs-algo-1.3.jar:..\..\..\libs\commons-math3-3.6.1.jar:. RunSimulation
